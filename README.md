# Jigsort

A few additions to jigsaw blocks:

- **Priority**: jigsaw blocks in a structure will generate in order of their priority, lowest first.
- **Conflict Modes**: configure jigsaw blocks to ignore structure collisions, leave the structure bounding box unchanged, or both.
- **Immediate Generation**: switch between breath-first and depth-first generation, or randomly mix them.

Additionally, structures' bounding boxes can now be configured in structure blocks independently of the area to save.
